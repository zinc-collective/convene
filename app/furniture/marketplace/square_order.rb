# SquareOrder encapsulates logic for coordinating and executing interactions
# between a Convene Marketplace and the seller's Square account. It could be
# described as a (budding) service or process class, but current behavior is
# limited to only registering orders in a seller's account upon sale.
#
# Registering orders serves to both synchronize record keeping between
# Marketplace managers owners (eg. Pikkkup) and sellers (eg. Crumble & Wisk)
# and automatically notify sellers of new orders.
#
# NOTE: the simple `Markeplace > SquareOrder` namespacing was chosen
# to avoid collision with the `Square` namespace already included by Square's gem.
#
# TODOS/considerations:
# 1. Implement validation of `order` argument on initialization
#   Eg: if order.is_not_valid?; exit; end
# 2. Implement state tracking
#   Eg: READY | ORDER_SENT | etc...
