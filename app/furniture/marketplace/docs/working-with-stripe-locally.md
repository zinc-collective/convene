# Setting up your local environment

Since Marketplace already implements Stripe with custom webhook endpoints, developers will only need to setup the tooling to build and test against the existing code.

## Create a Stripe account and connect a Marketplace

These instructions assume you don't already have a Stripe account. Developers who are familiar with Stripe and have developed with Stripe may skip steps as appropriate.

First, let's create and configure a Stripe account for testing:
1. [Sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
  - Consider using a different email from your personal email. Eg, `my.name+stripedev@gmail.com`.
  - Since you will only be using Stripe to test, you won't have to pay anything
1. When logged into your Stripe account, turn on `Test mode` in the top right of the dashboard.

For the "Connect to Stripe" flow to work, you will need to have a local development URL that is recognized by Stripe as "reachable". One way to do this is:
1. Add `127.0.0.1 convene.local` to your `/etc/hosts`
1. Access the app locally through `convene.local:3000`, instead of `localhost`
1. Optionally, add `convene.local` as the `branded_domain` to whatever Space you are using for testing, to shorten the URL you use to access it

Next, add your secret API key:
1. Click on the `Developers` button next to `Test mode` in the top right of your Stripe dasbhoard
1. Find your `Secret key` and copy it
1. Paste the key into `Api token` field on your Stripe Utility settings page
  - `http://convene.local:3000/spaces/<space_name>/utilities/<utiltiy_id>/edit`

Next, using the stripe cli, configure Stripe to forward events to your local environment by obtainining a webhook secret key:

1. Install [`stripe` cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) if you haven't already
1. Find the `--foward-to` url for your marketplace by printing the value of  `polymorphic_url(marketplace.location(child: :stripe_events))` from within a controller or view debug session
  - E.g. from view: `<%= debug polymorphic_url(marketplace.location(child: :stripe_events)) %>`
  - [Read more](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/test#webhook-test-cli)
1. Set stripe event forwarding to this url by executing: `$ stripe listen --forward-to <YOUR_FORWARD_TO_URL>`
1. Copy the webhook signing secret from the output. The output from the above command should look something like:
```
> Ready! You are using Stripe API Version [2022-11-15]. Your webhook signing secret is whsec_***** (^C to quit)
```
1. Update the marketplace settings directly in the database by adding the `stripe_webhook_endpoint_secret` to `public.furnitures.settings`

Finally, let's connect!

1. First, create a Connected account within Stripe by visiting [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/overview) and clicking the `+ Create` button in the "Connected accounts" section.

  - You might name this account something like `<Space_Name> Dev`
  - [Learn more](https://stripe.com/docs/connect)
1. Follow the UI prompost for creating a `Standard account`
1. Once your new Connected account is setup, go back into the app, visit `http://convene.local:3000/spaces/<space_name>/rooms/store/marketplaces/<furniture_id>/edit` and click the `Connect to Stripe` button
1. Verify that you see the `Stripe Connected!` success message on the page
