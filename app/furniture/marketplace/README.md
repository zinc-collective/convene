# Marketplace

## Human/Computer/Human Interaction Design

```mermaid

  title Purchase Flow
  section Placing an Order
    Begins Shopping: 1: Shopper
    Adds Product to Cart: 1: Shopper
    Checks out Cart: 2: Shopper
    Makes Payment: 4: Payment Processor, Shopper
  section Fulfilling an Order
    Receives Order: 0: Vendor, Distributor
    Fulfills Order: 0: Vendor
    Delivers Order: 0: Distributor
    Receives Order: 0: Shopper
```

```mermaid

  A([Shopper]) -- Visits --> B[Marketplace] -- Creates --> C[Cart]
```

```mermaid

title: Shopper Adds Product to Cart

  A([Shopper]) -- Creates -->  B[CartProduct] --> C[Product]
  B[CartProduct] --> D[Cart]
```

1. `Shopper` links `Product`s to their `Cart` by creating a `CartProduct` record which keeps track of things like quantity, discounts, special requests, etc.

```mermaid
---
title: Shopper Goes Through Checkout Flow
---
flowchart LR
  A([Shopper]) -- goes to Checkout Page --> B[Checkout] -- directs to --> C[Distributor] --> D[Payment Processor]
```

2. `Shopper` creates a `Checkout`, which directs them to the `Distributor`'s Payment Processor (Stripe, for now).

```mermaid
---
title: Shopper Completes Checkout
---
flowchart LR
  C[Distributor] --> D[Payment Processor]
  D[Payment Processor] -- payment successful --> D[Payment Processor] -- redirects --> E[Convene Order Page]
```

3. `Shopper` completes the Payment Processor's flow, which directs them back to Convene and updates the `Checkout` with payment processor details.

4. `Shopper` is redirected to the `Order`, which represents the `Cart` to the `Shopper` in a read-only manner.

## Architecture

The Marketplace uses Stripe for online payments. Developers should use the ["Connect then Transfer" workflow](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide) as a guide to the overall architectural pattern. At a high level, implementing this pattern boils down to three areas of concern:

1. Build the Workflow for connecting a Stripe Account
  - Currently implemented for Space administrators with a "Connect to Stripe" button
2. CheckoutÂ with Stripe Checkout, and include the `payment_intent_data` with a `transfer_group`: https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-transfer_group
3. Upon completion of Checkout, we transfer the Money: https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers

## Testing with Stripe

Stripe provides a host of tools for developers to build and test integrations with their own applications. But deciding how to take advantage of these tools in your own development process is less straight forward. If you're totally new to Stripe, make sure to generally familiarize yourself with Stripe's test capabilities. You might start by reading or scanning these docs start to finish:
* [Developer tools](https://stripe.com/docs/development)
* [Testing](https://stripe.com/docs/testing)



### On Github CodeSpaces
If you are using a Github CodeSpace, you will want to mark the web-server port as `public` so that Stripe can send it events.
