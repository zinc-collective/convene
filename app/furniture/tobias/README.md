# [TOBIAS, the TOpical Basic Income Administration Service](https://github.com/zspencer/convene/issues/1)
<!-- Pain: People are hungry and unhoused, yo. -->

Many people have insufficient free cashflow to cover reliable, healthy, and safe shelter, food, health care, and education.

So much energy is spent worrying about affording to live in a place that suits us, to eat food we enjoy, to receive care when we are hurting or infirm, or to develop ourselves further to the people we want to be.


<!-- Dream: What if people didn't have to worry as much about money? -->
What if people didn't have to invest so much of their daily energy on how to access reliable, healthy, and safe shelter, food, health care, and education?

What if education workers could spend more time focusing on teaching because they had access to additional income through a California Education Workers Basic Income Fund, their Teachers Union, or the American Association for Montessori Educators?

What if restaurants and grocers lowered prices because food workers receive a supplemental wage through the County Food Workers Living Wage Trust?

What if we all received a little-bit of cash every month thanks to the California Residents Basic Income Program?

<!-- Fix: Community-Operated, Automated Basic Income -->
TOBIAS combines democratic stewardship, financial automation, and trust fund management to reduce financial stress of people around us. It simplifies record-keeping, facilitates decision-making, and streamlines payments when administering a basic income fund for a region, industry, organization, or community.
