  # ------ #
  # NOTES
  # ------ #
  # Kelly H, Zee, Egbet decided these are the possible invitation statuses:
  # pending - email was not sent yet due to mailer issues etc.
  # sent - email was sent but not accepted
  # accepted - receiver accepted the invitation
  # rejected - receivers rejected the invitation

  # FUTURE STATUS AND TEST:
  # expired status and tests for testing the possible scenarios
end
