### Configuring your Development Machine

First, ensure your development environment has:
1. Ruby (See [.ruby-version](./.ruby-version) for version)
1. Node (See [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) for version)
1. [PostgreSQL 12](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

Then, run `bin/setup` to install Ruby and Node dependencies and set up the database.

Finally, run `bin/test` to ensure that your development environment is configured correctly.
