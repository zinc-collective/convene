Everyone in a [Space] is either a [Guest], [Neighbor], [Space Member], or [Space
Owner]. Until you identify yourself, you are a [Guest]. Some [Spaces] will have
[Rooms] or [Furniture] that are only for [Neighbors], [Space Members], or [Space
Owners].

The first time you enter a [Neighborhood], identifying yourself is a two-step
process: [Sign In] and [Set Up Your Profile].

Once you've set up your Profile for a [Neighborhood], it will be used in all of
that [Neighborhood's] [Spaces].

### Sign In

To switch from being a [Guest] to a [Neighbor], [Space Member], or [Space Owner]
use the [Personal Navigation Menu] to sign in.

You'll be asked to provide your email address, and follow the link we email you
to confirm you are the person who has access to that email address.

### Set Up Your Profile

Your _Profile_ is what other people know about you. This includes:

1. Your _Name_, so folks know what to call ya. This may be a pseudonym,
   nick-name, or even your full title; like "Dr. Cornelius Reginald The Third"
   or "Doc" or "Corny Reg" or... You get the picture.
2. Your _Pronouns_, (optional) which is how people refer to you when you're not
   around. Defaults to "they."
3. Your _Avatar_, (optional) so people can recognize you at a glance. This could
   be a real photo, a character, some art. The important part is picking one
   that is meaningful _to you_. Defaults to a randomly generated unique pattern.

Profiles _must not_ include slurs or other dehumanizing expressions. Each
[Neighborhood] decides what other kinds of expression is and is not acceptable
for them.

### Sign Out

When you are done in a [Space] you can stay signed in, or you can sign out so
that you start future visits to the space are as a [Guest].

To sign out, use the [Personal Navigation Menu].
