Sometimes, people in a Room want a bitÂ of privacy. Rooms can be _Locked_ by any
Member of the Space. When locked, Rooms require a _access code_ to enter. A Room's
lock can be added, changed, or removed on the Room's configuration screen.

## How To Lock a Room

1. Open the Room's configuration.
2. Select "Locked" from the "Access Level" drop-down.
3. Enter an access code.
4. Save your changes.

Locked Rooms show up with a "Lock" icon on the Space main page. People
attempting to enter a Locked Room will be prompted to enter the Room's access code.

People who entered the Locked Room before may enter automatically, so long as
the access code has not changed since they last entered the room.

## Some Caveats

1. Locking a Room does not remove any Occupants already in the Room, but it will
   require them to enter the access code when they attempt to return to the Room.
2. Unlocking a Room also requires the access code. If you forget the password,
   reach out to our support team and we'll unlock it for you.
