[Rooms] are the building blocks of a [Space]. Think of them just like [Rooms] in
a house or an office. You can [lock them](#locked-rooms) or
[leave them wide open](#unlocked-rooms). You can even
[hide them like a secret passageway](#hidden-rooms)!

Most [Rooms] have a specific purpose:

- A kitchen where you store your favorite recipes or publish your food pictures;
- a studio where you show off your art (and maybe take commissions or offer
  originals and prints for sale);
- an office for project materials and updates; or
- a front porch where you broadcast your stream-of-consciousness thoughts to the
  world and catch up with your neighbors and acquaintances.

To tune each [Room] for its purpose, fill it with [Furniture] that facilitates
activities or collect and share information.

[Rooms] may be added by [Space Owners] in [Space Configuration].

## Entering Rooms

Rooms can be entered in one of two ways:

1. Opening the [Room Link] _or_
2. Browsing the [Room Directory]

### Room Links

Room Links are specific to a particular room, and are the easiest way to share
what's in a Room with [Neighbors] and [Guests]. You can find the [Room Link]
through the [Share Action].

## Room Privacy and Security

When creating a [Room], [Space Owners] may want to think about who should be
allowed to see or enter the Room. There are three affordances for creating the
ideal privacy and security for a particular [Room].

1. [Hiding a Room](#hidden-rooms)
1. [Private Rooms](#private-rooms)
1. [Locking a Room](#locked-rooms)

### Hidden Rooms

While hidden rooms may only be found in the [Room Directory] by [Space Owners]
and [Neighbors] or [Space Members] who have entered the Room before, **_anyone
with the [Room Link] may access a hidden room!_**

If you want to keep the activities or information in a room private, you will
also want to make it [Locked](#locked-rooms) or [Private](#private-rooms).

Hidden Rooms can be found in the [Room Directory] by [Space Owners]; as well as
by [Neighbors] or [Space Members] who entered the Room since it was last Hidden.

### Private Rooms

Private Rooms can only be found and entered by [Space Members] and [Space
Owners].

If you want only [Space Members] who know the [Room Link] or have entered the
Room before to be able to find the room, consider also making it
[Hidden](#hidden-rooms).

If you want to further restrict access to only specific [Space Members] and
[Space Owners], consider [Locking the Room](#locked-rooms)

### Locked Rooms

Sometimes, a [Room] wants a bit of privacy. [Rooms] can be _Locked_ by any
[Space Member]. When locked, [Rooms] require an _[Access Code]_ to enter. A
[Room] can be locked and unlocked as part of [Room Configuration].

#### How To Lock a Room

1. Open the Room's configuration.
2. Select "Locked" from the "Access Level" drop-down.
3. Enter an [Access Code].
4. Save your changes.

[Locked Rooms] have a "Lock" icon on their door. People attempting to enter a
[Locked Room] will be prompted to enter the Access Code.

People who entered the [Locked Room] before may enter automatically, so long as
the [Access Code] has not changed since they last entered.

#### Access Codes

Access Codes are a shared secret between everyone who can enter a locked room.
They can be changed by the [Space Owners]. A [Room][access code] can be added,
changed, or removed as part of [Room Configuration].

#### Some Caveats

1. Locking a Room does not remove anyone currently in the [Room], but it will
   require them to enter the [Access Code] when they attempt to return to the
   Room.
2. Unlocking a Room also requires the Room's [Access Code]. If you forget it
   reach out to your [Operators], and they'll unlock it for you.
