# Convene

Community-owned tools to bring people together, online and off.

## Purpose

Many public domain, open-source, and free software products leverage the [Open
Core model] to be socioeconomically sustainable. The Open Core model allows
producers and maintainers to capture a portion of the wealth generated by their
efforts; but requires people or organizations to maintain their own
infrastructure tooling or pay privately held companies to host the services they
use.

As a result, much of the software tools to safely, securely, efficiently, reliably and
self-sufficiently host public-domain services is unavailable to the public.

Convene provides software tools to reliably, safely, and securely provision,
deploy, host and scale public-domain software services for personal, communal,
or organizational use.

## Using Convene

Convene is [pre-alpha software], so while we intend to provide interfaces that
do not require a high degree of technical skill to operate, our current phase
expects operators to be comfortable with infrastructure management techniques
and tooling such as [Ansible], [Hashicorp's product line][hashicorp-products],
or similar.

### Paid Support

Our paid support rate is pegged to 3x [the San Francisco Living Wage for a

This rate is negotiable for organizations that offer Zinc a [patronage
