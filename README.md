## Purpose

Convene is the _Means of Connection_. It's space to co-conspire, to relax, or
to push your limits. The premise behind Convene is simple:

1. Define a _Space_, with _Rooms_.
2. Gather _People_ in those _Rooms_.
3. _Do things_ together.

We provide the infrastructure.

You provide the purpose.

### Objectives

Convene is driving towards:

1. Face-to-face connection
2. For small groups
3. Co-creating a better future.

We're still figuring out how to make that happen, but that's our guiding light.

### Budget

At present, Convene allocates 33% of revenue towards infrastructure, 33%
towards operations, and 33% towards paying contributors and maintainers through
[Patronage Payouts].

## Using Convene

Convene is [pre-alpha software], so while we intend to provide interfaces that
do not require a high degree of technical skill to operate, our current phase
expects operators to be comfortable with infrastructure management techniques
and tooling such as [Ansible], [Hashicorp's product line][hashicorp-products],
or similar.

Convene is licensed under the [Prosperity Public License]. This provides
generous usage rights to individuals and non-commercial organizations to use

If your organization engages in commerce, defined as taking currency in exchange

Convene.

Pricing is determined on a case-by-case basis, with an emphasis on mutually
beneficial socioeconomic transactions.

### Help and Support

Support are encouraged to [create issues in our public issue
tracker][issue-tracker]. A maintainer will respond as they are available.

### How we Organize  <!-- omit in toc -->

* _Passport Holders_ vote on _Resident Representatives_.
* _Maintainers and Contributors_ vote on _Worker
Representatives_.
* Representatives sit in the [Circle of Stewards], and guide the [Budget] and set [Objectives].

### The Circle of Stewards  <!-- omit in toc -->

The Circle of Stewards is balanced 1 to 1 between Community Representatives and
Worker Representatives. This ensures that consensus must be reached between the
people using and the people building Convene.

## Footnotes <!-- omit in toc -->

### Paid Support <!-- omit in toc -->

Our paid support rate is pegged to 3x [the San Francisco Living Wage for a
couple with a single worker raising three children][san-francisco-living-wage].

This rate is negotiable for organizations that offer Zinc a [patronage
account][what-is-patronage] or corresponding equity stake.

Paid support clients may also request a deferred payment program, with terms to
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
