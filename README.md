## Overview

Convene is an _Operating System_ for **Community Owned Digital Infrastructure**.
Once deployed to a server, Convene is accessed by any web browser.

Convene serves as a community-owned, more ethical alternative to investor-owned online tools like
SquareSpace, Etsy, Patreon, Zoom, Yelp, and more.

A Convene Deployment is a _Neighborhood_. People create _Spaces_ in a _Neighborhood_, and fill those _Spaces_
with _Furniture_ to meet their collective digital needs. For example:

- A Regional Co-operative network could provide their members with shared payments and video communication infrastructure.
- A Farmer's Market could provide professionally designed websites and social media presences for their vendors.
- A Co-operative Startup Incubator could keep capitalization tables, Patronage Records and other logistical records.

Note: `Furniture` has been renamed to `Gizmo/Gizmos`.

You can see more in the [Zinc neighborhood](https://convene.zinc.coop).

We have two milestones we are working towards:

- Product Milestone:
  [1.0 Andromeda](https://github.com/zinc-collective/convene/milestone/1)
- Engineering Milestone:
  [Cleanup!](https://github.com/zinc-collective/convene/milestone/3)

## Using Convene

[Zinc] maintains a Convene Neighborhood at https://convene.zinc.coop. For people
who want to run their own Neighborhood of Spaces, consider purchasing a Convene
Operator License.

### Purchasing a Convene Operator License.

Individuals and non-commercial organizations may run their own Convene
deployment however they see fit without requiring payment.

However, if the person or organization engages in commerce, defined as taking
currency in exchange for goods or services, then the organization must purchase
a license to use Convene.

Pricing is determined on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out to
[`hello@zinc.coop`](mailto:hello@zinc.coop) for licensing information.

### Paid Support <!-- omit in toc -->

Our paid support rate is pegged to 3x [the San Francisco Living Wage for a
couple with a single worker raising three children][san-francisco-living-wage].

This rate is negotiable for organizations that offer Zinc a [patronage
account][what-is-patronage] or corresponding equity stake.

Paid support clients may also request a deferred payment program, with terms to
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
