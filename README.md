# Convene

Community-owned tools to bring people together, online and off.

## Purpose

Many public domain, open-source, and free software products leverage the [Open
Core model] to be socioeconomically sustainable. The Open Core model allows
producers and maintainers to capture a portion of the wealth generated by their
efforts; but requires people or organizations to maintain their own
infrastructure tooling or pay privately held companies to host the services they
use.

As a result, much of the software tools to safely, securely, efficiently,
reliably and self-sufficiently host public-domain services is unavailable to the
public.

Convene provides software tools to reliably, safely, and securely provision,
deploy, host and scale public-domain software services for personal, communal,
or organizational use.

## Developing Convene

Once you have installed the appropriate `ruby` and `node` and `postgresql` versions run `bin/setup`. See [Convene::Web/README.md "Configuring your Development Machine"] for more information.

## Using Convene

Convene is [pre-alpha software], so while we intend to provide interfaces that
do not require a high degree of technical skill to operate, our current phase
expects operators to be comfortable with infrastructure management techniques
and tooling such as [Ansible], [Hashicorp's product line][hashicorp-products],
or similar.

## Architecture

At present, Convene is split into three modules:

- `infrastructure`, which contains infrastructure management code for Packer,
  Terraform and Ansible.
- `web` which provides the human interface for Convene.
- `api` which stores data long-term and provides a programmatic interface.

## Design

We have a set of [Personas](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JwTh2uFTc6pxsXu3njEVKQrv-J5HWExhd1rgT-ravt4) that we use to guide our design and development. Designers who have agreed to protect the privacy of our clients may access our [Customer Research Interviews](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1gncYSkVIAj4CnlUZM9KPQlFdj_aqulDl)

## Footnotes

### Paid Support

Our paid support rate is pegged to 3x [the San Francisco Living Wage for a
couple with a single worker raising three children][san-francisco-living-wage].

This rate is negotiable for organizations that offer Zinc a [patronage
account][what-is-patronage] or corresponding equity stake.

Paid support clients may also request a deferred payment program, with terms to
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
