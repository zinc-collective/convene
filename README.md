## Overview

Convene serves as the _Means of Connection_. Create a Space to co-conspire,
relax, learn, play, work, swap recipes, read books, or really anything!

Convene provides the underlying infrastructure for a _Neighborhood of Spaces_.
_Operators_ help _Clients_ design their _Spaces_ and keep the Neighborhood up
and running. _Maintainers_ and _Contributors_ enhance Convene with:

- _Furniture_, fun toys and powerful tools
- _Utilities_, integrating external services like Stripe, Calendly, Jitsi, and
  more.

The Internet is for People, so why not put People in charge of their digital
spaces?

### Objectives

To put it succinctly, Convene provides:

1. Digital infrastructure, toys, and tooling
2. For small groups and individuals
3. Co-creating a better future.

We have two milestones in flight at any one time:

- Product Milestone:
  [1.0 Andromeda](https://github.com/zinc-collective/convene/milestone/1)
- Engineering Milestone:
  [Cleanup!](https://github.com/zinc-collective/convene/milestone/3)

## Using Convene

[Zinc] maintains a Convene Neighborhood at https://convene.zinc.coop. For people
who want to run their own Neighborhood of Spaces, consider purchasing a Convene
Operator License.

### Purchasing a Convene Operator License.

Individuals and non-commercial organizations may run their own Convene
deployment however they see fit without requiring payment.

However, if the person or organization engages in commerce, defined as taking
currency in exchange for goods or services, then the organization must purchase
a license to use Convene.

Pricing is determined on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out to
[`hello@zinc.coop`](mailto:hello@zinc.coop) for licensing information.

### Help and Support

Support are encouraged to [start a discussion][discussions]. Maintainers
respond as they are available.

Paid support is available for \$135 USD per hour<sup>[1][footnote-1]</sup>.

### Paid Support <!-- omit in toc -->

Our paid support rate is pegged to 3x [the San Francisco Living Wage for a
couple with a single worker raising three children][san-francisco-living-wage].

This rate is negotiable for organizations that offer Zinc a [patronage
account][what-is-patronage] or corresponding equity stake.

Paid support clients may also request a deferred payment program, with terms to
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
