  # A MediaBox may provide Recommendations based upon the Users in-the-moment curiosity, prior consumption, and
  # future intentions. The basic interaction flow uses a search box which can be expanded into weighted tag filter
  # groups for format, thematic content, content warnings, or creator identity.
  #
  # A MediaBox's Recommendation Engine may be tuned by a Resident, giving Neighbors and Visitors further curated
  # results.
