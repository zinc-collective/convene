Feature: Furniture - MediaBox (ðŸŒ°)
  # - Find Media to Consume!
  # - Maintain a History of your media consumption!
  # - Share your Reccommendations and AntiRecommendations!
  # - Generate Revenue for the Neighborhood through Affiliate Programs!
  #
  # Each Space operates a MediaBox and own their Reviews of the Media; while the
  # Neighborhood holds the information about how to acquire the pieces of Media
  # in they're particular formats, and generates revenue by injecting affiliate
  # marketing links into the Reviews/Recommendation results.
  #
  # Assuming the Neighborhood is operated as a Contributor/Community
  # Co-operative; profits would flow back to Contributors as part of the regular
  # Patronage redemptions, and back to the Community as Patronage Refunds or
  # reduced prices.
  #
  # There are likely three main use cases:
  # - "Reviewing Media" for people who like to keep a record and share what
  #   they've read/listened to/watched
  # - "Finding Media" for people who are like "What do I wanna watch/read/listen
  #   to?"
  # - "Reading Media Reviews" for people who want a more in-depth way of
  #   evaluating potential media choices.
  # - "Acquiring Media" once people have made a "I want this!" decision.

  # A MediaBox may provide Recommendations based upon the Users in-the-moment curiosity, prior consumption, and
  # future intentions. The basic interaction flow uses a search box which can be expanded into weighted tag filter
  # groups for format, thematic content, content warnings, or creator identity.
  #
  # A MediaBox's Recommendation Engine may be tuned by a Resident, giving Neighbors and Visitors further curated
  # results.
  #
  # Note: There is clearly a fractal of interesting nuance to explore here; which may be best defined in
