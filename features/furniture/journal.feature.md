# Feature: Journal

Many people maintain an online journal. Often, these journals are intended to connect with a broader collection of people via one-on-one or small group messages.

Journal entries are frequently responded to, remixed, or amplified.

Short-form journals, like Instagram or Facebook or Tiktok or Twitter; tend to prioritize entries which can be written or
read with little effort. These entries tend to flow through the internet like a stream; capturing and distributing peoples
thoughts and feelings in the moment.

Long-form journals, like medium or Substack, Wordpress, eleventy, Hugo or Jekyll; tend to prioritize posterity, pooling
information or wisdom into one place that others reference.

Perhaps this is overly ambitious, but Convene's journal is intended to play well with either format.

Authoring a Journal Entry has several steps:

1. Writing the Journal Entry.
2. Beautifying the Entry with Images, Animations, Video or other Media.
3. Contextualizing the Entry with meta-data like tags, links, or similar "hooks" into the broader Web.
4. Publishing the Entry, giving it a place in the world.
5. Distributing the Entry to the appropriate Channels; such as mailing lists, social media or even traditional media like the Associated Press.

For some authors, the most important part of a Journal are writing the entry. In Zee's case, he likes to blurt
things out. Others like to take a more thoughtful approach, writing in drafts that are revised.

For others, distribution is key. Getting the word out to the appropriate channels can provide a powerful tool for
organizing or building economic relationships.
