# Convene::Features::ParameterTypes

We use [Cucumber Parameter Types] to help keep our phrasing consistent when
describing the different adjectives and nouns within our domain model, as well
as to provide [affordances] for adding behavior specific to those nouns.

Parameter Types are automatically detected from a feature files Steps, and can
be transformed into JavaScript objects before being passed into step
definitions. This gives us a [seam] for customizing behavior within a step based
upon a feature definition without changing the step implementation.

For more information, see the [Cucumber parameter types] documentation, as well
as the [cucumber-js parameter types API reference].
