Feature: Locking Rooms
  In order to maintain control over who may participate in a conversation
  As a Workspace Member
  I would like to be able to lock Rooms


  Rooms have three different security levels:

  1. Unlocked, which grants access to anyone.
  2. Internal, which grants access to any Workspace Member.
  3. Locked, which grants access only to people who know the Room's Key.

  Design and discussion of the room access model may be found on GitHub at
  https://github.com/zinc-collective/convene/issues/12


  The following scenarios illustrate how these permissions play out
  based upon who is accessing rooms with which access level.

    And a Workspace Member may not enter the Room after providing the wrong Room Key
    And a Guest may enter the Room after providing the correct Room Key
    And a Guest may not enter the Room after providing the wrong Room Key

  # This is a "sad path" scenario, that we expect to delete once we
  # have proven it out; since it's unlikely to be necessary to continuously check
  # at the user-level; when we can rely on ActiveRecord validations and consistent
  # usage of form builders that expose error information.

    And the Room is Unlocked
