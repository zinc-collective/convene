Feature: Entering Rooms
  In order to interact with other People
  I want to enter a Room

  Rooms are where People gather, and can be entered in a number of ways.

  Most frequently, we expect people to enter a Room from their Space
  dashboard or by leaving one Room to enter another.

  However, we also want to support Reople entering a Room via
  the Room's full URI or from a short URI when a Space has a Branded Domain.
