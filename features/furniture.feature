Feature: Furniture
  In order to customize Rooms to fit their purpose,
  I would like to place Furniture in the Room.

# Background Context for Contributors:
#
# Furniture are distinct features within a Room. Each supports a type of micro-interaction in the Room.
#
# Many kinds of Furniture are adapters between services, while others are fully encapsulated features.
#
# Fully Encapsulated Furniture could be: Random Number Generator, A conversation stack manager
#
# For working Code examples and further developer documentation, check out app/furniture
#
# Most Furniture can be configured by Space Members to fit the specific needs of the specific Room.
